**What was challenging about this project?** ðŸ¤¬

  Basically fixing any broken links or designs from revising the code. Had to add some new rulesets to help mitigate the negative effects (Footer content had to be pushed down due to the main content being overlaid by main content.) One example was when adding a section element for the main content caused the content to be pushed up to the top, covering the background image. Had to use the top display rule to push it down top match the side content. I do hope to add creative ways to make the site interesting and code in the future as a beginning web-developer.
